# tstick.py
A simple no-nonsense script that converts images to telegram stickers.
input the images as parameters(globbing is accepted as well) and viola your stickers are ready!
the default output directory is ```"~/Pictures/tstickers"```
However you can override it with the ```-o``` flag.

# dependencies

# tip:
send the output images to t.me/stickers to create your own sticker pack.
