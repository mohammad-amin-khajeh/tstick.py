# tstick.py
A simple no-nonsense script that converts images to telegram stickers.
input the images as parameters(globbing is accepted as well) and viola your stickers are ready!

Please note that the image has to have a height or width of at least 512px

The default output directory is ```"~/Pictures/tstickers"```
however you can override it with the ```-o``` flag.

# dependencies

# tip:
send the output images to t.me/stickers to create your own sticker pack.
